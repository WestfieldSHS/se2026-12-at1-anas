        <p class="review-text">
          Ghost of Tsushima is a story built on guilt, honor, and the impossible
          choices that shape who we become. Jin’s journey hits hard because it
          isn’t just about fighting the Mongols — it’s about fighting himself.
          Every step he takes as the Ghost feels like a betrayal of the samurai
          code he was raised to protect, and that guilt follows him like a
          shadow. But the beauty of the story is how it shows that sometimes
          honor isn’t enough to save the people you love. Jin sacrifices the
          version of himself he was taught to be so he can become the person his
          island needs, even if it means losing everything else. The battles he
          faces aren’t just on the battlefield — they’re inside him, between
          tradition and survival, loyalty and freedom, who he was and who he has
          to become. It’s a story about carrying the weight of your choices and
          still choosing to stand up again, even when it costs you everything.

          <!-- Your review goes here -->
          Interstellar, for me, was one of the greatest pieces of film I have
          witnessed. There are many reasons why this movie is so special for me,
          but the main reason will have to be guilted. The emotions Cooper
          (Matthew McConaughey) portrayed were phenomenal. It was as if I was in
          his position yearning for his daughter. "Don't let me leave Murph" is
          one of the saddest scenes I've seen. Everything about this movie was
          amazing, from the cinematography to the acting to the CGI. All of it
          had a huge impact on making this movie special. Interstellar will go
          down in my top 3.
